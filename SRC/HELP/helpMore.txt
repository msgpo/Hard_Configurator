<MORE ...> button opens a menu with additional restriction options. 
The numbers on the right of this button, show the actual status of those
restrictions. For example #101010 means that the first, third, and fifth
option from additional restrictions are set to 'ON'. The rest are 'OFF'.
Some options are not marked as recommended, so they do not change
their status when pressing <Recommended Settings> button.
Those options can be used by advanced users.
