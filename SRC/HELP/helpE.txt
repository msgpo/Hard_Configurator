<Run As SmartScreen> button adds/removes ‘Run As SmartScreen’ or ‘Run By SmartScreen’ option in Explorer context menu - it works on Windows 8 and higher versions. Those options, force on demand file execution with SmartScreen check, for files located in the User Space. If the file is located in the System Space (inside 'Windows', 'Program Files ...'), then SmartScreen works as usual (not forced). 

Pressing <Run As SmartScreen> button changes between values:
'Administrator' -> 'Standard User' -> 'OFF'
The setting 'Administrator' corresponds to "Run As SmartScreen" option in  Explorer context menu.
The setting 'Standard User' corresponds to "Run By SmartScreen" option in  Explorer context menu.
The setting 'OFF' removes the above options from the Explorer context menu.

‘Run As SmartScreen’ option can check EXE and MSI files (also via shortcuts), and run them elevated if accepted by SmartScreen filter. All other files will be blocked (with notification) when 'Run As SmartScreen'.

'Run By SmartScreen' works as follows:
1. Executables (COM, EXE, MSI, and SCR files) located in the System Space are opened normally, without SmartScreen check.
2. Executables located in the User Space (= outside 'C:\Windows', 'C:\Program Files', 'C:\Program Files (x86)') are checked by SmartScreen before running.
3. Files located in the User Space with potentially dangerous extensions (scripts, most MS Office files, etc.), are not allowed to open (similarly to Software Restriction Policies), and the program shows an alert. 
4. Shortcut (*.lnk) to any file (target file) is managed as the target file.
5. Shortcuts (*.lnk) with a command line in the 'Target' area are always blocked, and the program shows an alert.
6. Compressed archives except ZIP (.7z, .arj, .rar, .zipx) are not opened - only the short instruction is displayed.
7. The popular files related to MS Office and Adobe Reader (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PUB, PPT, PPTX, ACCDB, PDF) are opened with the warning instruction and the MOTW is added to the file. 
8. Run By SmartScreen changes 'Protected View' setting in Adobe Reader 10+/DC, similarly to the default 'Protected View' setting in MS Office 2010+, so the above popular file types are forced to open in 'Protected View'.  
9. Other files (ZIP archives, media, photos, etc.) are opened normally without warnings.
