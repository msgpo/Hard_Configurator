<Whitelist By Path> button opens ADD / REMOVE / EDIT window for file / folder
whitelisting by path. This can be useful, when programs are located in User Space
(outside the folders: 'Windows', 'Program Files', and 'Program Files (x86)' ). 
Yet, User Space is not protected by UAC, so in theory, the malware could bypass
SRP, when running from the whitelisted path. Whitelisting popular locations in the
%USERPROFILE% is especially dangerous (AppData\Local, AppData\Local\Temp, 
Music, Pictures, Videos, Documents, Desktop, Downloads, etc.). 
The safer method (but less convenient) is whitelisting files by hash. 
Whitelisting by path a shortcut (LNK file) or a path with wildcards, is only possible
when using <Add Path*Wildcards> option. 
The Whitelist can be saved into the file, when using <Save Load> button on the right
side of the Whitelist buttons.

The users with installed Avast Antivirus set to Hardened Aggressive mode, can apply
'Allow EXE and TMP' option. The executables (*.exe and *.tmp) will be checked by
Avast Reputation Cloud and ignored by Hard_Configurator in the User Space.
The above solution is both very safe and usable.

WARNING!!!
It is forbidden to adopt environment variables when using <Add Path*Wildcards> option
to whitelist the paths!
