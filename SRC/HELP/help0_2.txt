There is no need to turn off Recommended Settings to install Windows Updates and perform system Scheduled Tasks.

10. In the Recommended Settings, almost all programs can be run as usual. New programs can be installed by using 'Run As SmartScreen' option from the right-click Explorer context menu. Downloaded programs cannot be run from the Web Browser. They should be saved, and then 'Run As SmartScreen' from the DOWNLOAD folder. Portable applications located outside 'Windows' and 'Program Files ...' folders, can be whitelisted by hash (or by path), and then run as usual.
