<Hide 'Run As Administrator'> button hides/shows 'Run as administrator'
option in Explorer context menu. It is useful when you choose to replace
this option by 'Run As SmartScreen'. 
Set <Hide 'Run As Administrator'> to "ON" if <Run As SmartScreen> is set 
to 'Administrator'. 
Otherwise, it is better to turn <Hide 'Run As Administrator'> 'OFF'.

REMARKS

When <Hide 'Run As Administrator'> is set to 'ON', then 'Command Prompt 
(Administrator)' option in Windows Power Menu, and 'Run as administrator'
option in the Search context menu, are hidden too. 
Yet, in the Search context menu, one can use 'Open file location', and then
use 'Run As SmartScreen' to run executables (EXE and MSI).
